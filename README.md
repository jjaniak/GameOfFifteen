The Game of Fifteen is a puzzle played on a square 4x4 board with 15 numbered tiles that slide and one empty space.

The goal of this puzzle is to arrange the board’s tiles using the empty space in order from smallest to largest, 
left to right, top to bottom, with an empty space in board’s bottom-right corner.
